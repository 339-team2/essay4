 **Appsmith vs MIT App Inventor**
 
Nowadays, we interact with apps on a daily basis. Since it's something so common, a lot of people may want to create an app of their own, however they may not have the requierd coding knowledge to create apps on tools such as AndroidStudio. Thankfully, there are open source projects available to help people with none to little coding experience to create the app of their dreams. First, there's [**Appsmith**](https://github.com/appsmithorg/appsmith), which we have been analyzing this semester, and another tool that is avaliable to develop apps is [**MIT App Inventor**](https://github.com/mit-cml/appinventor-sources). 

Even though the basic concept of these programs are similar, the audience for them are very different. MIT App Inventor is targeted towards people (mostly K-12) who want to get into coding and learn the basics. The interface of this IDE is similar to [Scratch](https://github.com/LLK/) where you can drag and drop blocks of code that connect with eachother.
